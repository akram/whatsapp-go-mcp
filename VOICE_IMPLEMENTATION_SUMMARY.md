# Voice Note Processing Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¤ What Was Implemented

I have successfully implemented a complete voice note processing system for your WhatsApp MCP server. Here's what was added:

### Core Functionality

1. **Automatic Voice Note Detection**: The system now automatically detects incoming voice notes (PTT messages) and processes them through a complete pipeline.

2. **Voice Processing Pipeline**:
   - **Download**: Downloads voice messages from WhatsApp
   - **Speech-to-Text**: Converts audio to text using Whisper
   - **AI Processing**: Processes transcribed text with LlamaStack agent
   - **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI response back to audio using espeak
   - **Audio Response**: Sends generated audio back as a voice message

### Key Functions Added

#### `processVoiceMessage(evt, audioMsg)`
Main orchestrator function that handles the complete voice processing pipeline.

#### `downloadVoiceMessage(evt, audioMsg)`
Downloads voice messages from WhatsApp using the whatsmeow library's `Download` method.

#### `speechToText(audioFilePath)`
Converts audio files to text using Whisper (supports both local and OpenAI API).

#### `textToSpeech(text)`
Converts text responses to audio using espeak and ffmpeg.

#### `processWithLlamaStackAgent(transcribedText)`
Processes transcribed text with the existing LlamaStack agent integration.

### Dependencies Required

The system requires these external tools:
- **ffmpeg**: Audio processing and format conversion
- **espeak**: Text-to-speech synthesis
- **whisper**: Speech-to-text transcription (OpenAI Whisper)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Installation Script**: `install_voice_deps.sh` - Automatically installs dependencies on macOS and Linux
2. **Test Script**: `test_voice_processing.sh` - Tests the voice processing functionality
3. **Documentation**: `VOICE_PROCESSING.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Configuration Options

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Use OpenAI Whisper API instead of local whisper
- **WHATSAPP_MEDIA_DIR**: Directory for storing temporary voice files
- Existing LlamaStack configuration for AI processing

### Error Handling & Fallbacks

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- If transcription fails â†’ Sends text message asking user to try again
- If TTS fails â†’ Sends text response instead of audio
- If AI processing fails â†’ Sends fallback text message
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### How It Works

1. **Voice Message Received**: When a voice note arrives, `handleAudioMessage` detects it as a PTT message
2. **Pipeline Execution**: `processVoiceMessage` orchestrates the complete processing pipeline
3. **Automatic Response**: The system automatically responds with an audio message containing the AI's response

### Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Install dependencies: `./install_voice_deps.sh`
2. Start the server: `./whatsapp-mcp-server`
3. Send a voice note to your WhatsApp number
4. The system will automatically process and respond with an audio message

### Files Modified/Created

#### Modified Files:
- `whatsapp/client.go`: Added voice processing functions and pipeline

#### New Files:
- `install_voice_deps.sh`: Dependency installation script
- `test_voice_processing.sh`: Testing script
- `VOICE_PROCESSING.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- Updated `README.md`: Added voice processing section

### Integration Points

The voice processing integrates seamlessly with:
- **Existing WhatsApp client**: Uses the same whatsmeow library
- **LlamaStack agent**: Reuses existing AI processing
- **Media handling**: Uses existing media directory structure
- **Error handling**: Follows existing error handling patterns

### Production Considerations

- **Performance**: Local whisper can be CPU-intensive; consider OpenAI API for production
- **Storage**: Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- **Security**: No voice data is permanently stored
- **Scalability**: Each voice processing is independent and can be parallelized

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use

The voice note processing system is now fully implemented and ready to use! Simply:

1. Run `./install_voice_deps.sh` to install dependencies
2. Start your server
3. Send voice notes to your WhatsApp number
4. Receive AI-powered audio responses automatically

The system will handle everything automatically - from downloading voice notes to sending audio responses back to users.
